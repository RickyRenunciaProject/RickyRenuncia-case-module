# Using this CASE Files Template

This repository holds a set of files that provide a template for creating your
own CASE File for contribution to the cases.umd.edu website. You may use the Git
fork feature (upper right button) to start your own CASE File repository,
starting from these files. Then you will have your own Git repository where you
can edit it into your own CASE File.

We also welcome suggested changes to this template itself, via GitHub pull requests.

## Template Files
* index.ipynb - Overview of the project subject matter and source data.
* lesson_plan.ipynb - Guidance for instructor who want to teach from these notebooks
* notebook-N.ipynb - Individual units or lessons that apply a computational technique to the data.
